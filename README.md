# Student-Information-Management


Consider a scenario of a school where everyday teachers, staff, authorities need to go
through the records of their students for various purposes like searching for a particular student’s
details. Manually going through records is a tedious job and also time-consuming. Hence, it is
better to develop in-school software that allows users to insert, update, search, or delete records
without manually going through documents every time a query arises.
Brief overview of the features In Student Record Management System :

1. Add Records - This feature allows you to add general information records. That includes
the student’s name, course and section. All the added records in this student database
management system are stored in file.
